# image-gallery

A responsive and accessible image gallery

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?  

I archieved all the main requirements and also added ARIA elements and a key binding.  

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?  

I didn't get round to using 'srcset' and using more @media queries and key bindings.  

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?  

One thing I wanted to do was add key bindings for left and right arrow keys to select the previous and next image. I wasn't able to figure this out, I think I would need to use the index somehow (currentIndex -1 to go back +1 to go foward)?

User Stories:

🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.  

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images so my screen reader can interpret and convey the content to me effectively.  

🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery using clicks plus tab+enter so that my experience is smooth and intuitive.  

Requirements:

🎯 Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).  

🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.  

🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
